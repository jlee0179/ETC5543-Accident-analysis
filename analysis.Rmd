### Questions:

1. How are drivers' characteristics (Depot, gender and age) affecting the incidents? Which is contributing the most incidents?'

How are drivers' characteristics (Depot, gender and age) affecting the incidents? Do they genuinely contribute to the occurrence of incidents?

0.02 < 0.05 Reject the null hypothesis. The data provides strong evidence that gender does have an effect on incidents.

The small ( <5%) p-value suggests that the null hypothesis of equal proportions can be rejected. Difference in gender doesn't have an effect on incidents.

2. On what day have most incidents been found? Which hours are the peak and trough?

```{r}

  distinct(EmployeeID, ClaimCategoryId, DateOccurred, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(day_week = weekdays(as.Date(DateOccurred))) %>%
  group_by(day_week) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x = factor(day_week, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")), total_cases)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label=total_cases), vjust=1.6, color="white", size=3.5)+
    theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Total claim number", x = "Day", title = "Total claim by day of the week")
```

```{r}

    theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Total claim number", x = "Hour", title = "Total claim by daily hours")

```

3. Has daytime or night been a significant cause of incidents?

```{r}
daynight_incidents <- incidents %>%
  drop_na(EmployeeNumber) %>%
  distinct(EmployeeID, ClaimCategoryId, DateOccurred, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(DateOccurred))

daynight_incidents %>%

                               hour < 19 ~ "day")) %>%
  group_by(day_night) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_night, y = total_cases, fill = day_night)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label=total_cases), vjust=1.6, color="white", size=3.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Daytime/night", y = "Total claim number", title = "Total claims made during daytime and night")
```



4. What kind of weather (temperature and precipitation) is considered safer or dangerous for bus drivers?

```{r}
dh_mva_incidents <- incidents %>%
  drop_na(EmployeeNumber) %>%
  distinct(EmployeeID, ClaimCategoryId, DateOccurred, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(date_hour = format(DateOccurred, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H")) %>%
  filter(company %in% c("TDNSW", "TDM"),
         str_starts(TypeOfClaimName, "MVA"))

melbourneweather <- melbourneweather %>%
  mutate(company = "TDM",
         date_hour = format(timestamp, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H")) %>%

  mutate(company = "TDNSW",
         date_hour = format(timestamp, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H")) %>%
  rename(Temperature = `Sydney Temperature`, Precipitation = `Sydney Precipitation Total`)

mel_syd_weather <- rbind(melbourneweather, sydneyweather)

weather_n_incidents <- mel_syd_weather %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(timestamp)) %>%
  left_join(dh_mva_incidents, by = c("company", "date_hour")) %>%
  mutate(Temperature = as.numeric(Temperature),
         Precipitation = as.numeric(Precipitation),
         rain = case_when(Precipitation >= 2.5 ~ "Yes",
                          Precipitation < 2.5 ~ "No"),
         has_incident = case_when(is.na(ClaimNumber) ~ "No",
                                         !is.na(ClaimNumber) ~ "Yes"))

weather_n_incidents %>%
  filter(rain == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Precipitation, group = has_incident, fill = has_incident)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~company, nrow = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels=c("Non-incident", "Incident")) +
  labs(x = "Rainfall (mm)", title = "Incident and non-incident distribution under rainy condition measured by precipitation") +
  expand_limits(x = -0.5)


```

```{r}

  expand_limits(x = -0.2:2.4)


```

```{r}
weather_n_incidents %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Temperature, group = has_incident, fill = has_incident)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(~company) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels=c("Non-incident", "Incident")) +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", title = "Incident and non-incident distribution measured by temperature")

```



5. Is there a relationship between drivers' driving hours within a day and the likelihood of getting into an incident?

```{r}
tmp2_when_occur <- tmp2 %>%
  filter(match_type == 2) %>%
  distinct(EmployeeID, ClaimCategoryName, DateOccurred, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(diff_occur_start = difftime(DateOccurred, shift_start),
         diff_occur_start = diff_occur_start/dhours(),
         hour = hour(DateOccurred),
         day_night = case_when(hour >= 19 | hour %in% c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) ~ "Night",
                               hour < 19 ~ "Day")) %>%
  filter(str_starts(TypeOfClaimName, "MVA"))
tmp2_when_occur$diff_occur_start <- round(tmp2_when_occur$diff_occur_start, digits = 0) 

ggplot(tmp2_when_occur, aes(x = diff_occur_start)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 25, alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_grid(~day_night) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Number of hour(s) after shift start", title = "Hour(s) that claims made after drivers' driving hours in NSW")

```

FIT a model to predict incident, understand the relationship between variables. Random forest (suggested), can discover non-linear relationship, build tree diagrams, get variable importance. e.g. given an hour, is it going to be incident or not. variables e.g. gender, hour of driving, weather, time of day.

Mean Decrease Accuracy: How much the model accuracy decreases if we drop that variable.
Mean Decrease Gini: Measure of variable importance based on Gini impurity index used for the calculation of splits in trees.

Rain distribution can do t-test, test significance. NOTE: look up requirements for t-test.
two-sampled t-test

```{r}
# compare precipitation between has_incident=yes and has_incident=no
rain_inc <- weather_n_incidents %>%
  select(Precipitation, has_incident) 
# has_incident = yes
summary(rain_inc %>%
          filter(has_incident == "Yes") %>%
          .$Precipitation)

summary(rain_inc %>%
          filter(has_incident == "No") %>%
          .$Precipitation)
```

```{r}
ggplot(rain_inc, aes(Precipitation)) +
        geom_histogram(fill = "white", color = "grey30") +
        facet_wrap(~has_incident) +
        scale_x_log10()
```

```{r}
wilcox.test(Precipitation ~ has_incident, data = rain_inc)
# is associated, relationship
```

Temperature: 

```{r}
temp_inc <- weather_n_incidents %>%
  select(Temperature, has_incident) 
# has_incident = yes
summary(rain_inc %>%
          filter(has_incident == "Yes") %>%
          .$Temperature)

summary(rain_inc %>%
          filter(has_incident == "No") %>%
          .$Temperature)
```

```{r}
ggplot(temp_inc, aes(Temperature)) +
        geom_histogram(fill = "white", color = "grey30") +
        facet_wrap(~has_incident) 
```

```{r}
t.test(Temperature ~ has_incident, data = temp_inc)
# the existence of significance difference
```

Comparing with rainfall, temperature is more associated with the occurrence of accidents.
